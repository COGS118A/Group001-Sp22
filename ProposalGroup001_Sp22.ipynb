        "Heart disease is a common cause of death in the United States. There are a variety of factors that contribute to the likelihood of heart disease. However, not all variables increase the chance of cardiovascular disease in the same amount. In this paper we will create a predictive machine learning model that is effective in detecting heart disease by using data originating from the Center of Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC). Factors such as smoking, alcohol use, or stroke history. We will be running a logistic regression as well as a random decision forest. By analyzing this data set, we aim to better prevent cardiovascular disease and thus remove heart disease as a leading cause of death in the United States. Performance will be measured by if the factors directly or indirectly influnce heart disease. \n",

        "According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. However, the prediction of cardiovascular disease still remains as a challenge in the area of clinical data analysis despite the continuous growth of science and technology. It goes without saying that identifying coronary heart disease during the early stages is beneficial in minimizing the development of the disease and thus preventing the need for treatment. Therefore it is extremely important to continue to develop more effective ways of more accurately identifying risk factors that play a role in predicting heart disease. \n",
        "\n",
        "Previous research has shown that traditional cardiovascular risk factors are nearly equally valuable in assessing the likelihood of someone developing CHD as a looking at a genetic test. The risk factors listed include blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, and smoking status<a name=\"Wilson\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Wilsonnote). Even though the genetic risk scores doesn't seem to necessarily add more predictive value, it is still necessary to develop a model that uses either traditional or genetic variables to more accurately predict CHD. Another article states that there is no clear difference in the effectiveness of using either categorical or continuous values of those risk factors in the prediction. Furthermore, the article discusses the limitations of their findings because of the exclusion of certain candidate variables. Such variables include family history of CHD, fibrinogen, exercise, and body mass index (BMI)<a name=\"UTSouth\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#UTSouthnote). Therefore, further research needs to be done on the predictive value of these excluded variables as well as the effectiveness of having a mixture of discrete and continuous variables in the predictive model.\n",

Machine learning algorithms have been used in the past to detect and address the severity of the heart disease of patients. In terms of accuracy, random forest, support vector machine, deep learning, VOTE, and HRFLM are some of the best classification methods<a name=\"Mohan\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#Mohannote). Although this paper has analyzed the effectiveness of different machine learning models, further extension is needed to use real-world datasets on these models as the paper only used simulations and theoretical approaches.

We will be using a group of techniques in order to balance the class distribution for our dataset since it has a skewed class distribution. By classifing our variables in a binary \"Yes\" or \"No\" format, we can predict which factors play a role in heart disease. We will run this alongside our whole dataset in order to replicate it with over 400,000 other patients in order to see if our model is accurate."

Some crucial variables are sex represented by \"Male\" and \"Female\" and age which is represented by an interval. Some boolean values are represented by \"Yes\" or \"No\". We will need to transform these values into a numerical format (1s and 0s) in order to process them. We also have categorical variables like General Health which we can convert numerically with one hot encoding. Given these variables and which observations had heart disease, we will be able to predict how attributes contribute to cardivascular disease the most and take steps in order to prevent disease."

Therefore, it is important that there is no way to tie a particular data point to any one individual, so it is anonymized. In terms of bias, one thing we do want to watch out for is to make sure that all the states in United States are represented in the dataset as to prevent bias, such as how differences in lifestyles in different states could impact risk for heart disease. To get a representative figure for each state, we consider the states as a whole, taking into account all of the regions as one. In order to address these concerns in bias, we have used a dataset from Kaggle that was originally from the CDC as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). CDC states that BRFSS  collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. The dataset also includes over 300,000 survey responses. As a result we can ensuring that a large majority of the regions in the United States could be represented in this study.\n",

Due to the fact that our data is anonymized, this project cannot be used to single out or direct harm to an individual. At its base, this project just offers an unbiased study on a prediction model for heart disease.Â "
